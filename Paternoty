Subject: Paternity Leave Notice

Hello Jason,

Hope you’re doing well. I’m happy to share that my wife and I are expecting our first child, with the due date around 19 November 2025. I’ll be taking two weeks of paternity leave once the baby arrives. I’ve already spoken with Frederik and he’s aware of the plan.

I’ll make sure everything is in order before my leave. Please let me know if you need anything from me ahead of time.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
