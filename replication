Database refresh breaks Qlik’s internal publication tracking.

_00019 is Qlik’s auto-generated next publication, not something SQL Server created.

The SQL error occurs because either:

The database is read-only, or

The publication doesn’t exist yet.

You need either to create the publication manually or reset Qlik task metadata.
